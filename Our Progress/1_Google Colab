Initially, the idea of developing our project on Google Colab emerged.
This platform offers us an opportunity to collaborate on a common file.
Within our Colab, we structured our work by attributing a distinct title to each method used, 
along with its precision displayed on Kaggle.

For our First try we will start by doing a OneHotEncoder on our
train dataframe and then we will predict the difficulty of the texts
by training our model.
