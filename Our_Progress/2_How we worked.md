# How did we manage to do the project ?


In our project focused on predicting the difficulty levels of French texts, Antoine and I adopted a collaborative strategy, ensuring our efforts were complementary and efficient. We began by structuring our tasks: I concentrated on drafting detailed reports, while Antoine focused on developing the Streamlit application. To streamline our collaboration, we used Trello for project management, keeping each task meticulously updated with relevant details and progress notes. This system was instrumental in keeping both of us informed and in sync throughout the project.

Our modeling journey was a blend of academic concepts and practical exploration. Initially, we experimented with models we had learned about in our coursework, like Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. However, we soon realized the limitations of these models in processing text data, as they couldn't fully capture the linguistic nuances needed for our task. This led us to pivot towards more text-focused models. We delved into Spacy for its linguistic feature extraction capabilities and then transitioned to advanced models like RNN and BERT. The RNN was particularly useful for its ability to process text sequentially, while BERT's contextual understanding of language significantly boosted our accuracy.
A notable aspect of our collaboration was our use of Google Colab. It served as a shared platform where we could both access and test various models. One major challenge we encountered was the significant time required for model execution and training. This aspect occasionally complicated our project's progress. To mitigate this issue, we strategically utilized Google Colab's T4 GPUs instead of regular GPUs. The T4 GPUs offered us better performance and efficiency, enabling us to handle the computational demands more effectively and keep the project moving forward.

Our journey through this project was marked by a blend of methodical planning, continuous learning, and adaptive problem-solving. By leveraging the strengths of different models, technologies, and collaborative tools, we were able to navigate the complexities of text classification and achieve our project objectives.
