Hello everyone, we're Antoine Oglobleff and Manuel Solazzo and we're the Migros team for this Project.

Here you'll find all the files we've worked on to enable us to have a program that can predict the language level of a French text. We'll also put in all the thoughts that led us to use the right method.

If you want to learn more about all the work we've done, and how we arrived at this result, I'll let you browse the various folders contained in our GitHub.
