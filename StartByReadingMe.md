<h1>Project-DSML - TEAM <span style="color: orange;">MIGROS</span></h1>



Hello everyone, we're Antoine Oglobleff and Manuel Solazzo and we're the Migros team for this Project.

Here you'll find all the files we've worked on to enable us to have a program that can predict the language level of a French text. We'll also put in all the thoughts that led us to use the right method.

 

We are pleased to present this detailed guide to navigating our GitHub repository.

Analysis of the Model Folder: 

This primary folder contains a thorough analysis of our various models.

Erroneous Predictions File:

Model's Dashboard File:

'Data' Folder: 

Here, you'll find all the data you provided to us, along with a 'training_data_2' CSV file representing a duplication of the training data.

'Our Progress' Folder: 

This folder offers an in-depth view of our team's methods and working processes, highlighting efficiency and collaboration within our group.
